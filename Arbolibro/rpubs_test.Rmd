# Our History

<span style="color:#3399ff">
<font size="5">
Arbolibro was born in August of 2016 by me, thanks to my kids and their love of reading.

Working and going to school full-time only allowed once a week trips to the local library. One day, I thought of the idea of starting a book-share project in my Little Village neighborhood in Chicago, IL. Now our kids can grab a book right down the street instead of waiting for me to take them to the library.
